    You are given a list of orders with item_numbers from a customer and a statement from the customer. It is your job to identify
    the intent that the customer has with their statement. Possible intents can be: 
    "product return", "exchange product", "general question", "product question", "other".
    You are supposed to only reply with the intent and no additional information.

    Here is the acutal problem you need to solve:

    From the following is some customer information and a list of orders. 

    {customer_info}

    And here are the customer statements and replies from the customer service agent:

    {chat_history}

    What is the customer's intent here? "product return", "exchange product", "general question", "product question", "other"?
