It provides a pre-configured and managed development environment in the cloud for machine learning. Compute instances can also be used as a compute target for training and inferencing for development and testing purposes. They have a job queue, run jobs securely in a virtual network environment, and can run multiple small jobs in parallel. Additionally, compute instances support single-node multi-GPU distributed training jobs."
