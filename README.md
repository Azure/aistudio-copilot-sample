# Getting Started

This repository is part of the [Azure AI Studio preview](https://aka.ms/azureai/docs).

## Step 1: Set up your development environment

To get started quickly, we recommend to use a pre-built development environment. **Click the button below** to open the repo in GitHub Codespaces, and then continue the readme!

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure/aistudio-chat-demo?quickstart=1)

Note: This will build a development environment using the Docker container definition in [.devcontainer/Dockerfile](.devcontainer/Dockerfile), and will start a VS Code instance running in that environment. 

If you want to set up your local development environment, please refer to the instructions [here](https://aka.ms/aistudio/docs/sdk) on how to manually install the Azure AI CLI and SDK on your machine.

## Step 2: Connect to Azure Resources

Login to azure and connect to an Azure AI project:

 - In VS Code, open a new terminal by pressing ```Ctrl-Shift-` ```.
 - Login to azure by typing ```az login --use-device-code``` 
 - Run ```ai init``` and select **Azure AI Project + OpenAI + Cognitive Search** to create a new Azure AI resource and project or connect to an existing project.

This will generate a config.json file in the root of the repo, the SDK will use this when authenticating to Azure AI services.

## Step 3: Run the sample notebook

Open and run the sample notebook to create, evaluate, and deploy a chatbot built using Azure OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Search, and Langchain:
 - Open the notebook: [src/langchain/langchain_qna.ipynb](src/langchain/langchain_qna.ipynb)
 - Press `Ctrl-Enter` to run each cell
    - When you run the first cell you may be prompted to select your kernel, choose `Python Environment` and select the `Python 3.10.x` environment.
 - Open your project in [AI Studio](https://aka.ms/AzureAIStudio) to view the generated indexes, evaluation runs, and endpoints.

## Additional Tips and Resources

### Follow the full tutorial

For a more detailed tutorial using this notebook, you can follow the [Build a co-pilot using the Azure AI SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azureai-insiders/blob/aistudio-preview/previews/aistudio/tutorials/copilot_with_sdk.md) tutorial.

### Customize the development container

You can pip install packages into your development environment but they will disappear if you rebuild your container and need to be reinstalled (re-build is not automatic). You may want this, so that you can easily reset back to a clean environment. Or, you may want to install some packages by default into the container so that you don't need to re-install packages after a rebuild.

To add packages into the default container, you can update the Dockerfile in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`, and then rebuild the development container from the command palette by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` and selecting the `Rebuild container` command.
