# Getting Started

This repository is part of the [Azure AI Studio preview](https://aka.ms/azureai/docs).

## Step 1: Set up your development environment

To get started quickly, you can use a pre-built development environment. **Click the button below** to open the repo in GitHub Codespaces, and then continue the readme!

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure/aistudio-copilot-sample/tree/oct-refresh?quickstart=1)

If you want to get started in your local environment, first install the packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/azure/aistudio-copilot-sample
cd aistudio-copilot-sample
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then install the Azure AI CLI, on Ubuntu:
```
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureAICLIDeb | sudo bash
```

To install the CLI on Windows and MacOS, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Azure/azureai-insiders/blob/main/previews/aistudio/how-to/use_azureai_sdk.md#install-the-cli).

## Step 2: Create and connect to Azure Resources

Run ai init to create and/or connect to existing Azure resources:
```
ai init
```

- This will first prompt to you to login to Azure
- Then it will ask you to select or create resources, choose  **AI Project resource** and follow the prompts to create an Azure OpenAI resource, model deployments, and Azure AI  search resource
- This will generate a config.json file in the root of the repo, the SDK will use this when authenticating to Azure AI services.

Note: You can open your project in [AI Studio](https://aka.ms/AzureAIStudio) to view your projects configuration and components (generated indexes, evaluation runs, and endpoints)

## Step 3: Build an Azure Search index

Run the following CLI command to create an index that our code can use for data retrieval:
```
ai search index update --files "./data/3-product-info/*.md" --index-name "product-info"
```

Now, generate a .env file that will be used to configure the running code to use the resources we've created in the subsequent steps
```
ai dev new .env
```

## Step 4: Run the co-pilot with a sample question

To run a single question & answer through the sample co-pilot:
```bash
python src/run.py --question "which tent is the most waterproof?"
```

You can try out different sample implementations by specifying the `--implementation` flag with `promptflow`, `semantickernel`, `langchain` or `aisdk`. To try running with semantic kernel:

```bash
python src/run.py --implementation semantickernel --question "what is the waterproof rating of the tent I just ordered?"
```

To try out the promptflow implementation, double check deployment names (both embedding and chat) in `src/copilot_promptflow/flow.dag.yaml` match what's in the `.env` file.

```bash
python src/run.py --question "which tent is the most waterproof?" --implementation promptflow
```

The `--implementation` flag can be used in combination with the evaluate command below as well.

## Step 5: Test the co-pilots using chatgpt to evaluate results

To run evaluation on a copilot implementations:
```
python src/run.py --evaluate
```

You can also run pytest to run tests that use evaluation results to pass/fail
```
pytest
```

This will run the tests in `src/test_copilot.py` using the `evaluation_dataset.jsonl` as a test dataset. This will compute a set of metrics calculated by chatgpt on a 1-5 scale, and will fail that metric if the average score is less than 4.

## Step 6: Deploy the sample code

** NOT YET WORKING **

To deploy one of the implementations to an online endpoint, use:
```bash
python src/run.py --deploy
```

To test out the online enpoint, run:
```bash
python src/run.py --invoke 
```

## Additional Tips and Resources


### Follow the full tutorial

For a more detailed tutorial using this notebook, you can follow the [Build a co-pilot using the Azure AI SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azureai-insiders/blob/aistudio-preview/previews/aistudio/tutorials/copilot_with_sdk.md) tutorial.

### Customize the development container

You can pip install packages into your development environment but they will disappear if you rebuild your container and need to be reinstalled (re-build is not automatic). You may want this, so that you can easily reset back to a clean environment. Or, you may want to install some packages by default into the container so that you don't need to re-install packages after a rebuild.

To add packages into the default container, you can update the Dockerfile in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`, and then rebuild the development container from the command palette by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` and selecting the `Rebuild container` command.
